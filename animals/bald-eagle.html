    <p>
      The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a large bird of prey found in
      North America. It is the national bird and symbol of the United States of
      America.

    <h2>Characteristics of Bald Eagles:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bald eagles have a white head and tail, with a dark brown body and
        wings.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are known for their impressive size, with wingspans reaching up to
        7 feet (2.1 meters).
      </li>
      <li>
        These birds of prey have powerful beaks and talons, which they use for
        catching and tearing apart their prey.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bald eagles primarily feed on fish, swooping down from great heights to
        snatch fish from the water's surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        They also eat other birds, small mammals, and carrion (dead animals).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bald eagles build large nests, called eyries, in tall trees near bodies
        of water.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are monogamous and often mate for life, returning to the same nest
        each breeding season.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bald eagles are known for their impressive aerial displays, including
        dramatic courtship flights and territorial defense.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conservation Status:</h2>
    <p>
      The bald eagle was once endangered due to habitat destruction, hunting,
      and the effects of the pesticide DDT. However, conservation efforts,
      including legal protection and habitat restoration, have led to a
      remarkable recovery in population numbers. It was removed from the U.S.
      Endangered Species List in 2007 and is now classified as "Least Concern"
      by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
