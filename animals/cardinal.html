    <p>
      The northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) is a species of bird in the
      family Cardinalidae. It is a medium-sized songbird with a distinctive
      crest on the head and a mask-like face pattern. Male northern cardinals
      are brilliant red, while females are primarily tan with red accents.

    <h2>Characteristics of Northern Cardinals:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Northern cardinals are known for their loud, clear songs, which are
        often heard during the breeding season.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are found in North and Central America, ranging from southern
        Canada to northern Argentina.
      </li>
      <li>
        These birds prefer woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and swamps as their
        habitats.
      </li>
      <li>
        Northern cardinals are omnivores, feeding on seeds, fruits, insects, and
        occasionally small lizards or frogs.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are non-migratory birds, typically staying in their territories
        year-round.
      </li>
      <li>
        Males are territorial and will defend their nesting sites and food
        sources vigorously.
      </li>
      <li>
        Female cardinals build cup-shaped nests in bushes or dense vegetation,
        where they lay eggs and raise their young.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are often spotted at bird feeders, especially in winter when food
        sources are scarcer.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conservation Status:</h2>
    <p>
      The northern cardinal is abundant and widespread across its range, and it
      is not considered globally threatened. However, like many bird species, it
      faces threats such as habitat loss due to urbanization and pesticide use.
      Conservation efforts focus on preserving their preferred habitats and
      raising awareness about the importance of biodiversity.
