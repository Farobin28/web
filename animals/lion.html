    <p class="description">
      The lion is a species in the family Felidae. It is a muscular,
      deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round
      ears. A lion's coat is yellow-gold, and adult males feature a mane of
      long, dark hair that encircles their heads, which is perhaps their most
      iconic feature.

    <h2 class="section-title">Characteristics of Lions:</h2>
    <ul class="characteristics-list">
      <li>
        Lions are highly social animals, living in groups called prides. These
        prides often consist of related females, their offspring, and a small
        number of adult males.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are primarily found in savannas and grasslands, but also in forests
        and even deserts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lions are powerful predators, known for their hunting prowess. They
        primarily hunt large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeest, and buffalo.
      </li>
      <li>
        Males defend the pride's territory, which can be quite large, by
        roaring, marking with scent, and occasional fights with other males.
      </li>
      <li>
        Female lions do most of the hunting, working together to surround and
        ambush prey.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cubs are born blind and rely on their mother for the first few months of
        their lives.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are different subspecies of lions, with varying sizes and colors
        depending on their region.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Conservation Status:</h2>
    <p class="conservation-status">
      Lions face various threats in the wild, including habitat loss,
      human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. As a result, they are classified as
      "Vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
      Conservation efforts are underway to protect lion populations and their
      habitats.
