    <p>
      The rattlesnake is a group of venomous snakes in the genera Crotalus and
      Sistrurus of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). They are
      recognized by their distinctive rattle located at the end of their tails.

    <h2>Characteristics of Rattlesnakes:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rattlesnakes are found throughout the Americas, from southern Canada to
        Argentina.
      </li>
      <li>
        They have a unique rattle on their tails made of loosely attached
        keratin segments, which produce a buzzing sound when shaken as a warning
        signal.
      </li>
      <li>
        These snakes have a triangular-shaped head, heat-sensing pits on their
        faces (pit organs), and hinged fangs for injecting venom.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are carnivorous, feeding on small mammals, birds, lizards, and even
        other snakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rattlesnakes are vital to their ecosystems as both predators and prey.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are excellent ambush predators, often waiting for prey to pass by
        before striking with their venomous bite.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some species of rattlesnakes exhibit various color patterns, ranging
        from shades of brown and grey to reddish hues.
      </li>
      <li>These snakes are generally solitary, except during mating season.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conservation Status:</h2>
    <p>
      Rattlesnakes face threats such as habitat loss, human persecution, and
      road mortality. However, they are not globally endangered as they are
      adaptable and widespread. Conservation efforts focus on habitat
      preservation and public education to promote coexistence with these
      important reptiles.
