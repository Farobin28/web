    <p>
      The red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) is a large bird of prey found
      across North America. It is one of the most common and widespread hawks in
      North America, known for its distinctive red tail.
    </p>

    <h2>Characteristics of Red-tailed Hawks:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Red-tailed hawks have a broad, rounded wingspan that can reach up to 4
        feet (1.2 meters) in length.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are named for their brick-red colored tail feathers, which are most
        prominent in adults.
      </li>
      <li>
        These hawks have a mottled brown and white plumage, with a pale
        underside and dark markings on the wings and back.
      </li>
      <li>
        Red-tailed hawks are powerful predators, feeding on small mammals like
        rodents, rabbits, and squirrels, as well as birds and reptiles.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are often seen perched on poles, trees, or soaring high in the sky,
        searching for prey.
      </li>
      <li>
        These hawks have keen eyesight, allowing them to spot prey from great
        distances.
      </li>
      <li>
        During courtship displays, red-tailed hawks engage in aerial acrobatics,
        including spiraling dives.
      </li>
      <li>
        They build large nests made of sticks and twigs, usually in tall trees,
        where they raise their young.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conservation Status:</h2>
    <p>
      The red-tailed hawk is not considered globally threatened and is a species
      of "The Least Concern" according to the International Union for
      Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, like many raptors, they can face threats from habitat loss,
      collisions with vehicles and structures, and sometimes persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conservation efforts focus on habitat preservation, nest site protection,
      and education about the importance of these birds in ecosystems.
