    <p>
      The black-tailed deer, also known as the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus),
      is a species of deer found in western North America. It is named for its
      large mule-like ears.

    <h2>Characteristics of Black-tailed Deer:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Black-tailed deer have distinctively large ears, which can move
        independently to pick up sounds from various directions.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are named "mule deer" because of their large, mule-like ears.
      </li>
      <li>
        These deer have a grayish-brown coat with a white throat patch and a
        black-tipped tail, from which they get their name.
      </li>
      <li>
        Black-tailed deer are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, twigs,
        fruits, and grasses.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are excellent jumpers and can clear obstacles up to 2.5 meters (8
        feet) high.
      </li>
      <li>
        Males, known as bucks, grow antlers that are shed and regrown annually.
      </li>
      <li>
        During the mating season, or rut, males compete for females by
        displaying their antlers and engaging in ritualized fights.
      </li>
      <li>
        Females, known as does, give birth to one to three fawns, usually in
        late spring or early summer.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conservation Status:</h2>
    <p>
      The black-tailed deer populations are generally stable, although certain
      subspecies may face threats from habitat loss and hunting. They are
      important to ecosystems as herbivores, shaping plant communities through
      their feeding habits. Conservation efforts focus on habitat preservation
      and sustainable hunting practices where applicable.
