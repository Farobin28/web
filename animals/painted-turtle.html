    <p>
      The painted turtle is a species of freshwater turtle native to North
      America. It is known for its colorful markings, which give it its name.

    <h2>Characteristics of Painted Turtles:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Painted turtles have a smooth, olive to black carapace (upper shell)
        with red and yellow stripes or markings, resembling painted artwork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Their plastron (lower shell) is yellow with dark markings along the
        edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        These turtles have a relatively small size, typically reaching 4 to 10
        inches (10 to 25 cm) in length.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are found in ponds, lakes, marshes, and slow-moving rivers,
        preferring areas with ample vegetation and basking sites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Painted turtles are omnivores, feeding on aquatic plants, insects,
        crustaceans, and small fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are cold-blooded reptiles, basking in the sun to regulate their
        body temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        During the winter, painted turtles hibernate at the bottom of bodies of
        water, sometimes buried in the mud.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are known for their ability to retract into their shells for
        protection when threatened.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conservation Status:</h2>
    <p>
      Painted turtles are common and widespread across North America, and their
      populations are generally stable. However, they face threats such as
      habitat loss, pollution, and collection for the pet trade. Conservation
      efforts focus on preserving their natural habitats, reducing pollution,
      and raising awareness about the importance of protecting these turtles and
      their ecosystems.
